modifications for quake 
 
 
I just wanted to add to my game some modifications as zoom in and zoom out(changing the scope) using click for zoom in and space bard for zoom out.To make it possible after change the code you have to type in the console
bind mouse2 "cmd zoom 1"
bind space "cmd zoom 0"
in a way to make it possible.

 i modiffy the time of explosion of one grenade so its not going explote fast(it will take 60 seconds for explote)
Also another modification like cluster grenades that once we shut one grenade will splite in 4 .
